# Gameplay Mechanics
- Infinite Sidescroller
- Single Player
- 3 types of enemies: Tall Zombie, Short Zombie, Boss 
- 3 PowerUps - Fire Breathing, Dash of fire, Stop

# Level Design 
- Zombies are spawned randomly and at different locations
- When the probablity of zombies has reached a milestone amount a boss apears and the scene stops scrolling until either the player dies or the boss dies
- Level Prgress is NOT saved, player must go back everytime 

#Technical
- Controls: Tapping the screen at different heights and sides will control the basic functions of hitting and moving, then shield will be controlled by the player touching the viking himself, and specials will be buttons that are pressed and located in the corner of the screen.
- Scenes: WHOLE game will be one scene where there will be an intal time line that willl act like a menu and other menu element that will pop up when the player dies.
